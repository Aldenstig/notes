<b>How the everything works</b>
<p>The defenitions of <b>Browser, Internet, HTTP and Server</b>:</p>

The <b>Browser</b> is what you use to get on the internet. Some examples of browsers are chrome, firefox and safari
<br>The <b>Internet</b> is what i can use to go to a website.</br>
<b>HTTP</b> is what connects the servers with the internet. It stands for
<em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>
<br><b>Servers</b> are a bunch of boxes that collects all the data.</br>

<p> The process of all of this is that a person uses a browser on their comptuer to get on the internet.
  When you go on to a website it always starts with http. For example i want to go to apple.com, in the browser
  it will say http//:www.apple.com. The http is a way for the internet to comunicate with the servers that apple use.
  They are just a bunch of boxes that collect data that they can send back using the http to the internet that
  i am using my browser to get on to.

<b>Inline and Block</b>
<p>There is a difference between inline elemnets and block elements.
  Some <em>inline</em> tags are: <br><em>a, span, img, strong and br.</em></br> br is a litle tricky since it can look
  like a block tag. Some examples of <em>block</em> tags are <br><em>p, div, form and hr.</em></br>
  You can read more about block elements and inline elements at
